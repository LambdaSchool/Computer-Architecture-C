Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
The CPU provides concurrency because it allows for multitasking.  Like how we call to use the CALL instruction and then perform a task before the next instruction.  I believe this is similar to how concurrency works. 

Describe assembly language and machine language:
Assembly language is human readable. Machine language is where the computer can read it.  For example, this answer can be read by a human but not necessarily by a machine and or computer. I would have to use a combination of 0's and 1's that translates to letters on a keyboard for the computer/machine to understand what to put on the screen. Even then the machine doesn't have feelings or understanding of what it all means, more just following instructions of what to place on the screen.
