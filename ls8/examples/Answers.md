Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:

    The CPU can do multiple things by having multiple cores, or using interrupts, a single CPU can execute one program. This would then switch back and forth between different programs seamlessly. While not true parallelism, this is how modern operating systems appear to do so much at once.

Describe assembly language and machine language:

    Assembly language is more like a human readable view of machine language. Instead of representing the machine language as numbers, the instructions and registers, they have will have names(for example "PRN", "ADD"). On the other hand, assembler is very close to the machine language, when compared to high level languge.
