10000010 # LDI R0,8; Call LDI instruction; this also tells cpu to interpret next two lines as numeric value parameters for LDI
00000000 # == 0; this is the register R0 utilized by LDI
00001000 # == 8; this is the value that gets put into cpu->reg[0]
01000111 # PRN R0; call PRN instrunction to print value at register index given on next line
00000000 # == 0; this is the register index with the value to be printed; the result of all this is print(cpu->reg[0])
00000001 # HLT; HLT instruction to halt and exit
