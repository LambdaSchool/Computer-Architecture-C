#Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
    The CPU is capapable of orchestrating multiple events in a parallel fashion via both external and internal resources, such as the ALU, Registers, RAM, and Disk, that it may use to store and manipulate data.

#Describe assembly language and machine language:
    Assembly language is a step of abstraction from machine language and is used to assemble machine language. Machine language is pure binary, while assembly still retains a semblance of human language via the inclusion of letters.
