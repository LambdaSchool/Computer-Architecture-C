 2's compliment
 IEEE-754 for floating point

 1’s complement of a binary number is another binary number obtained by toggling all bits in it, i.e., transforming the 0 bit to 1 and the 1 bit to 0.

Examples:

1's complement of "0111" is "1000"
1's complement of "1100" is  "0011" 
2’s complement of a binary number is 1 added to the 1’s complement of the binary number.
Examples:

2's complement of "0111" is  "1001"
2's complement of "1100" is  "0100"
